# Hospital-Management-System

### AIM: 

To develop the Hospital management System using Star UML tool. 

### PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
It is very imporatant to maintain efficient software to handle information of a 
hospital. This application provides a way to record this information and to access these 
in a simple way. 

### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
Rational Rose,SQL 8.0 

### HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
1.512MB RAM 
2.Pentium III Processor

# USECASE DIAGRAM:

A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, 
and organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible 
sequences of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and 
related to a particular goal. It is represented using ellipse. Actor is any external entity 
that makes use of the system being modeled.

# ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:

An activity diagram is a variation or special case of a state machine in which 
the states or activity representing the performance of operation and transitions are 
triggered by the completion of operation. The purpose is to provide view of close and 
what is going on inside a use case or among several classes. An activity is shown as 
rounded box containing the name of operation.

# CLASS DIAGRAM:

A class is drawn as rectangle box with three compartments or components 
separated by horizontal lines. The top compartment holds the class name and middle 
compartment holds the attribute and bottom compartment holds list of operation

# PACKAGE DIAGRAM:

A package diagram is represented as a folder shown as a large rectangle 
with a top attached to its upper left corner. A package may contain both sub ordinate 
package and ordinary model elements. All uml models and diagrams are organized into 
package. A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the 
dependencies between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) 
shows a grouping of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML PDs 
can be used to show groups of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components 
or processes in Component Diagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment 
Diagrams (DPDs). 
There are three types of layer. They are 
1.User interface layer 
2.Domain layer 
3.Technical services layer

# SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:

A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a kind of 
interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what 
order.

# COMMUNICATION DIAGRAM:

A collaboration diagram is similar to sequence diagram but the message in 
number format. In a collaboration diagram sequence diagram is indicated by the 
numbering the message. A collaboration diagram, also called a communication 
diagram or interaction diagram, A sophisticated modeling tool can easily convert a 
collaboration diagram into a sequence diagram and the vice versa. A collaboration 
diagram resembles a flowchart that portrays the roles, functionality and behavior of 
individual objects as well as the overall operation of the system in real time.

# RESULT:

The UML Diagrams for Hospital-Management-System have been successfully created and implemented using StarUML.
